# Visual Novel Arcade

Visual Novel Arcade is a web platform designed for creatives and gamers alike. It allows users to create, play, and publish interactive visual novel games. Whether you're a storyteller looking to share your narrative or a player searching for engaging stories, this platform is built to bring your vision to life.

## Features

- **Interactive Home Page**: Utilizing [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), to get smooth on-scroll animations for an engaging user experience.
- **Text Search**: Quickly find visual novels by typing keywords into the search bar.
- **Tag-Based Search**: Search for visual novels using tags to filter results based on genres, themes, or other attributes.
- **Advanced Tag Filtering**: Use advanced tags to include or exclude specific tags simultaneously, giving you precise control over your search results.
- **User-Friendly Design**: A clean and intuitive interface ensures a seamless experience for both creators and players.
